//! BGP peer FSM (RFC 4271 §8).
//!
//! Implements the 6-state peer state machine:
//! `Idle → Connect → Active → OpenSent → OpenConfirm → Established`.
//!
//! The FSM is event-driven. Events are passed to [`BgpPeer::step`] which
//! returns a list of [`BgpAction`]s for the embedder to dispatch (send bytes,
//! arm/cancel timers, install/withdraw routes, etc.).
//!
//! Inbound bytes are pushed via [`BgpPeer::feed_bytes`] which decodes them and
//! feeds the resulting [`BgpMessage`]s into the FSM. Outbound bytes are
//! drained via [`BgpPeer::drain_outgoing`].
